Thinking Trains is an open source hardware and software project for the
development of a new control system featuring "self-driving" trains. The goal
is to be able to operate a model railway using a signalling panel interface.
Trains will respond to signals as routes are set and cleared either by the
operator or automatically to a timetable.

This is distinct from a traditional control system where operators move trains
directly, through either an analogue or a digital control system. In the
traditional model the operator assumes the role of both train driver and
signalman whereas with Thinking Trains, during normal operation, the operator
will adopt the role of signalman alone.

The project will require the development of new electronics, software and
mechanical components to achieve the goal of self-driving trains. The designs
and source for these components will be shared and licensed for use free of
