Thinking Trains is the idea of me, Rob Voisey, an embedded engineer based in
Cambridge UK. I plan to develop most of the hardware and software for the
project, and build the King Cross layout. However I hope to attract some
interest in the project and bring on collaborators as it grows.

You can contact me at [rob@thinkingtrains.org](mailto:rob@thinkingtrains.org).

## Collaborators

**Rob Schofield** has been involved with Thinking Trains since the
conceptualisation stage with feedback and good ideas.

**Patrick Arnold**, Fen's hardware guru by day, has provided many useful hardware
suggestions and hopefully can be persuaded to wield his soldering iron when
teeny tiny components require glueing to circuit boards.
