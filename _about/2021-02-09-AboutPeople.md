Thinking Trains is the idea of me, Rob Voisey, an embedded engineer based in
Cambridge UK. I plan to develop most of the hardware and software for the
project, and build the King Cross layout. However I hope to attract some
interest in the project and bring on collaborators as it grows.

As well as a fun project, I plan to use the Kings Cross layout as a
technology demonstrator at trade shows for my company, [Fen Consultants Ltd](https://fenconsultants.com).
Tech consultancy trade booths are usually boring as hell - this one
won't be!

## Collaborators

**Rob Schofield** has been involved with Thinking Trains since the
conceptualisation stage with feedback and good ideas.

**Patrick Arnold**, Fen's hardware guru by day, has provided many useful hardware
suggestions and hopefully can be persuaded to wield his soldering iron when
teeny tiny components require glueing to circuit boards.
