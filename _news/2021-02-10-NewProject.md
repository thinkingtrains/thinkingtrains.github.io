Welcome to the Thinking Trains web site! This is an open source project
to develop new technology for controlling a model railway, for which the
trains will drive themselves.

I've been thinking and planning for several months, as well as slowly
acquiring materials, and now the time has come to begin the detailed design
and build. I'll populate this site over the coming days and weeks so please
check back soon!

The project goals are live now in the [About](https://www.thinkingtrains.org/about/)
section.
